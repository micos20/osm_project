The above mentioned csv file *NVONB.INTERNET.20200916.ONB.csv* containing all valid German area codes is used to identify the the area code within the *number*. This file is loaded and stored as dict *area_codes*. After stripping off the country code the remaining *number* consists of the *area* and the *subscriber* part. The code below is the actual engine to extract the area code. \n",

    "# Extract area code from number\n",

    "for i in range(2,6):        # Area code consists of 2 to 5 digits\n",

In the first run of the loop it assumes the area code to be of *i=2* digits length and compares the code with the valid codes of length *i=2* in the dict *area_codes*. If *area* is found in *area_codes* the remaining part of *number* is the *subscriber* part and the job is done. If *area* is not found the next iteration starts. The area code is assumed to be *i=3* digits and the new *area* is compared to all valid *area_codes* of length *i=3*. This procedure is repeated until a valid area code is found.
